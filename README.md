# SyntheticImageSegmentationForFirearms
This year, our SHTEM lab worked on image segmentation. Focusing on the social issue of gun violence, we aimed to build a model that can detect and outline firearms in an image. Limited online datasets motivated us to ask how data augmentation and creating synthetic images could affect a model's performance on real data.
